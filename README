Project Homepage: www.spoerr.org/wktools

Dependencies:
- Boost 1.59
- wxWidgets 2.8.12
- OGDF
- Lua
- Luabind
- sqlite3
- wxPropertygrid
- libssh2
- cryptlib 3.4.3 will be removed once migration to libssh2 is done
- mysql

Current major initatives:
- wktools version 5 (will be added to github soon)
- Replacement of SSH library; At the moment cryptlib is used for SSH but there are many limitations and therefore I need to replace the SSH library.

Most variable naming and code documentation is in german at the moment but this will be changed in the future.

For the ToDo list please refer to todo.txt in the projects root directory
